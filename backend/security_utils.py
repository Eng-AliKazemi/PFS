Provides security-related utility functions for the application.

The primary function in this module, `validate_and_resolve_path`, is a critical
security component designed to prevent path traversal (also known as "directory
traversal" or "../") attacks.

When a path is received from an untrusted source, such as an LLM's output or a
user's input, it must be validated to ensure it points to a safe and permitted
location. This function canonicalizes the path to its absolute form and then
verifies that it is located within the user's home directory. This prevents
any operation from accessing or modifying sensitive system files outside of the
intended scope.
